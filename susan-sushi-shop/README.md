# Susan's Sushi Shop 🍣

This is a full-stack web application.

## Setup Instructions

### Backend

1. Navigate to the `backend` directory.
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Create a `.env` file and set up your database credentials.
4. Run the server: `node src/app.js`

### Frontend

1. Navigate to the `frontend` directory.
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Run the frontend: `npm start`

## Database

1. MongoDB is used. I've not included the env file in gitignore in order to ease the setting up of the project and its database in your system. Will update it again after evaluation.
<!-- Run the SQL scripts in `backend/sql/create_tables.sql` to set up the necessary tables. -->
